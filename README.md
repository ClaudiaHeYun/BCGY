## Homology representations of compactified configurations on graphs
[arXiv: 2109.03302](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03302).

### Abstract
We obtain new calculations of the top weight rational cohomology of the moduli spaces $\mathcal{M}_{2,n}$, equivalently the rational homology of the tropical moduli spaces $\Delta_{2,n}$, as a representation of $S_n$.  These calculations are achieved fully for all $n <= 11$, and partially - for specific irreducible representations of $S_n$ - for $n <= 22$.   We also present conjectures, verified up to $n=22$, for the multiplicities of the irreducible representations std_n and its conjugate.

We achieve our calculations via a comparison with the homology of compactified configuration spaces of graphs. These homology groups are equipped with commuting actions of a symmetric group and the outer automorphism group of a free group. In this paper, we construct an efficient free resolution for these homology representations. Using the Peter-Weyl Theorem for symmetric groups, we consider irreducible representations individually, vastly simplifying the calculation of these homology representations from the free resolution.

### Abstract
We construct, for all $g\ge 2$ and $n\ge 0$, a spectral sequence of rational $S_n$-representations which computes the $S_n$-equivariant reduced rational cohomology of the tropical moduli spaces of curves $\Delta_{g,n}$ in terms of compactly supported cohomology groups of configuration spaces of $n$ points on graphs of genus $g$.  Using the canonical $S_n$-equivariant isomorphisms $\widetilde{H}^{k-1}(\Delta_{g,n};\mathbb{Q}) \cong W_0 H^i_c(\mathcal{M}_{g,n};\mathbb{Q})$, we calculate the weight $0$, compactly supported rational cohomology of the moduli spaces $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ in the range $g=3$ and $n\le 9.$
