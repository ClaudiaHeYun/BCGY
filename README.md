This repository hosts the code for the paper titled *Homology representations of compactified configurations on graphs applied to M_{2,n}* by Christin Bibby, Melody Chan, Nir Gadish, and Claudia He Yun. [arXiv: 2109.03302](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03302).

### Abstract
We obtain new calculations of the top weight rational cohomology of the moduli spaces M_{2,n}, equivalently the rational homology of the tropical moduli spaces Delta_{2,n}, as a representation of S_n.  These calculations are achieved fully for all n <= 10, and partially - for specific irreducible representations of S_n - for n <= 22.   We also present conjectures, verified up to n=22, for the multiplicities of the irreducible representations std_n and its conjugate.

We achieve our calculations via a comparison with the homology of compactified configuration spaces of graphs. These homology groups are equipped with commuting actions of a symmetric group and the outer automorphism group of a free group. In this paper, we construct an efficient free resolution for these homology representations. Using the Peter-Weyl Theorem for symmetric groups, we consider irreducible representations individually, vastly simplifying the calculation of these homology representations from the free resolution.
